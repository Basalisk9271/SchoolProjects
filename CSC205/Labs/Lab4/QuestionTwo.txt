A) The difference between the size fo an arraylist and the capacity is that size is the current number of 
objects in the arraylist while the capacity is how many things that the arraylist can hold before the space 
allocated for it needs to double

B) An arraylist can store as many elements that the user would like to until the computer runs out of RAM; 
the arraylist's capacity will expand and shrink as needed 

C) You can easily add or remove items from an arraylist without having to run a loop and an arraylist can 
be created and does not have to have a parameter but can grow however long the user may need it to

D) Arrays have a fixed length that cannot be changed at all. Also, arrays must be homogenous with the same 
type of object (i.e. an array of strings or an array of ints)
